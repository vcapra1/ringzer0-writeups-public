# vcapra1's RingZer0 CTF Writeups

The writeups are organized by category, as on the website, then by number.  Each writeup is a single PDF file, encrypted with the MD5 sum of the flag as the password.

For example, if the flag is `FLAG-SUPERSECRETFLAG`, then the password can be found by

```Bash
echo -n "FLAG-SUPERSECRETFLAG" | md5sum
```

This would output `78d178916fbd806043a43e04081fcc12`, so to unzip the file, use that as the password.
